# nand-to-tetris ('The Elements of Computing Systems' implementation in Verilog)

This repository provides Verilog implementations of the various hardware projects from the book "Essentials of Computing". While the book uses a custom HDL, this project aims to bring those designs to a more widely-used industry standard: Verilog.

## Setup and Requirements

- Personally using EDA Playground and EP Wave to run simulations

## Usage

Feel free to use these designs as reference or for your own learning. If you spot any issues or have optimizations to suggest, please open an issue or pull request.

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/someFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add someFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/someFeature`).
5. Open a new pull request.
